## Technical Interview Prep

These are the best online resources that I used while preparing for technical coding interviews:

* [Cracking The Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/): The most popular book on the whole tech interview process, now in 6th edition. 189 programming interview questions are included, ranging from the basics to the trickiest algorithm problems.
* [Elements of Programming Interviews](http://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/): Another great book written by professional software engineers, with different versions in C++, Java and Python.
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/): A technical recruiting platform that assesses developers based on actual coding skills.
* [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/): A free online peer-to-peer platform for practicing technical interviews.
* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/): One of the best online resource providing a rich library of more than 300 real coding interview questions with 7 supported languages - C, C++, Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, Ruby.
* [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/): Another site that preps software engineering candidates for coding interview.

## Time and Space Complexity

## Sorting Algorithms

## Tree

Review the [tree](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/trees-95qda) data structure.

## Tree Traversals

Tree traversals are commonly used in interviews. Learn about pre-order, in-order and post-order traversal in [this video](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/tree-traversal-fr51b).

## Backtracking

Learn about backtracking in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBC_Fd8EE8A).

## Binary Search

Implementing a binary search is a common interview question. Learn about binary search in [this Khan Academy page](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/binary-search/a/binary-search).

## Breadth First Search

Breadth First Search (BFS) is a widely used interview question. Learn about it in [this video](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/algorithms-part2/breadth-first-search-DjaET).

## Depth First Search

Depth First Search (DFS) is a widely used interview question. Learn about it in [this video](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/algorithms-part2/depth-first-search-mW9aG).

## Recursion

Learn about recursion in [this video](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/principles-of-computing-2/recursion-ccrwD).

## Reading Code

As an engineer or scientist, significant time is spent reading code others have written. Our advice for you to understand code written by others is to read a lot of code and try to figure out its goal. You can find tips for reading code in [this page](https://wiki.c2.com/?TipsForReadingCode). Also, you can find some advice on how to quickly read other people's code [here](https://selftaughtcoders.com/how-to-quickly-and-effectively-read-other-peoples-code/).
